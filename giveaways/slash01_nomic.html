<h1>Slash 01, by windpowerstake</h1>
<h2>Background</h2>
Slashing events are penalty occurrences when a validator sub-performs on a network. This is the first ever (combined) set of slashes that we suffer in our 2 year of operation. The slashing quantity has been very minimal (-0.1%), so if a delegator had 100 tokens on us, after the slashing event they would have 99.9 tokens.
<p>This document will explain how each staker will be refunded (failure is on us).

<h2>Risk and challenges of validating</h2>
<p>Part of validation focus on getting proper uptime on signing infrastructure. Uptime is part of the security of each blockchain, while downtime might lead to voting power imbalance. Therefore it makes sense to slash a fraction of the staking power delegated to a validator if this validator spends more time than an appropriate maintenance period (between 24h and 48h response times)
<p>Windpowerstake validates with their own bare metal machines in a secure racked cabinet in a Datacenter. We have physical access 24/7. Machines are our private ownership.
<p>If you trusted on us, please keep the trust up. Together we secure the network and make the stake game more diversity.

<h2>Number of events by windpowerstake: 2 downtimes with circa 40h each</h2>
<p>
<p>Windpowerstake operates on juno, evmos, jackal, teritori, chihuahua, nomic, migaloo and others.
<p>While windpowerstake has never been slashed (0) for downtime in conventional Cosmos SDK networks, the slashing happened twice in Nomic. This happened over the period of 1.5 years of operation.


<h2>Slashed quantity: -0.1%</h2>
<p>
<p>Nomic slashes reduce the staked quantities by -0.1%. This is a symbolic penalty in comparison with many other networks. This is reasonable, since this is in a very experimental phase and the set of tools are still increasing as the chain develops. The novelty of the nomic code on the tendermint format plays an important role on expecting tollerance from this system.


<h2>Rationale for both slashings: When monitoring fails</h2>
<p>
<p>Part of validation focus on getting proper uptime on signing infrastructure. Uptime is part of the security of each blockchain, while downtime might lead to voting power imbalance. Therefore it makes sense to slash a fraction of the staking power delegated to a validator if this validator spends more time than an appropriate maintenance period (between 24h and 48h response times)
<p>The network is being monitored by a self-done algorithm, however, the set of rpcs that operate need to be monitored constantly in order to make the reference of valid nodes
<p>As a validator we are working on reinforcing monitoring and put more reference nodes to check on our status
<p>Courtesy of Zenchain Labs, our status can be seen here: https://nomic.zenscan.io/validator.php?addr=nomic194jgp9n50jk35pen6v63cnltyt90wevycsh75h


<h2>Method: Send script</h2>
<p>This will be an automatic refund.
<p>Date of the send: TBC
