<h2>Thanksdrop 01, by windpowerstake</h2>
<h3>Background</h3>
Airdrops performed by validators might be a chance to engage their respective communities. 

<h3>Risk and challenges</h3>
<p>Any giveaway action might be perceived as a way to capture more delegations in an endless cycle of delegating-getting presents. The general idea is that validators don't run at losses and they dedicate to really invest their commissions in hardware, software, hours, transports and deliveries, and their general security infrastructure. Some validators even run as a company, which should take care of health and education of the workers which ultimately can lead to less downtime.
<p>Because of the previous reasons, any giveaway might be perceived as dumping of the previous rule. In general we would say that everyone needs to use their common sense and try to perceive if an airdrop, promo, or giveaway action creates more community or value than it substracts (also looking at the short term).
<p>A third consideration on airdrops and promotions is that they are advertised widely on determined social networks (e.g.: Twitter) and given a short spanning period of time, our users might not have enough time to react to the novelty and the need of reaction that each promotion might require.
<p>(cont... ref. to Polkachu's post on climbing validation positions)

<h3>On airdropping art, made by artists</h3>
<p>The art of airdropping and tipping cryptocurrency, there's a win-win situation when the holder of an asset shares part of their wealth with the community. The sense of ownership of a token or piece of art makes it much more valuable and it adds a background positive experience for both parts. We specially like the art, because (in the same way as modern picture expositions) artists might find out that their art is sparse around an entire community, making it even more worthy to release derivative works, developing trademark, developing community or calling for expos. Web3 really makes this topic much more traceable and accessible for creators around the globe. Ultimately everyone wins in this three party relationship, airdropper, community and creator. Life is about giving and receiving. For the ref.: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4-0v05lK_U"><i>Cada uno da lo que recibe.</i></a>

<h3>On airdropping fan tokens or fan NFTs</h3>

<h3>Thanksdrop complementation to March's airdrop by sunshine</h3>
<p>(cont...)


<h3>1 Lucky winner</h3>
<p>This promo will focus on selecting randomly a lucky winner.
<p>Selected NFT is a cat, from the Cosmic Cat Collection at Omniflix. <a href="https://omniflix.market/nft/onftd6c975251746400faaec30222b8b5dfd">City of the Skies</a>. Akashia... the city in the sky... powered by the clouds.
<p>This NFT was sitting a the ground price of 5 ATOM and we bought it for the scope of this airdrop. The contents include a nice starship cruising over the city of Akashia, which seems to be powered by the energy gathered on clouds. A cat sits on the cockpit. The ship is powered by a battery of  
<p>Method in order to calculate if an address is participating is provided:<a href="https://windpowerstake.github.io/main/giveaways/thankdrop01/thankdrop01.py">Download python script</a>
<p>Selection method will be mechanical/probabilistical, we'll select a card from a maze containing only one address.
<h4>Participant list: huahua, juno, cerberus</h4>
<p>On our best attempt to honour the mentioned March promotion, we included all chihuahua addresses which probably participated, and kept their delegation through time. This includes chihuahua delegations to sunshine, ECO stake and CARBONZERO.
<p>Also in order to not leave behind our dear delegators from other chains, we made them also participants (in this case only windpowerstake) in order to give them a possibility of opting in.

<h4>Participant list: nomic</h4>
<p>Regarding nomic, we must give thanks to the Stake Frites team, which wrote a rust script that gave us access to our delegations in nomic.
