<h1>The Wind DAO</h1>
The WIND DAO is an experiment made the night of the 03.02.2022, where the $WIND token was minted and a DAO in order to experiment with governance. The $WIND token was airdropped to $JUNO stakers at validator "windpowerstake", and this was done in this way in order to make it easy.
<br>
<h2>Tokenomics</h2>
<p>50%: 8214 $WIND in the DAO Treasury
<p>50%: 8214 $WIND divided between 74 initial delegators (03.02.2022)
<br>
<p>As the initial distribution was our first attempt, we are going to ask all initial delegators to experiment with staking tokens in the DAO. In the case a LP of $WIND tokens is created, there is little control we can exert, as we own just 2 of the initial 74 delegators (1.3%)

<p>In any case it is recognized that the initial distribution is not optimal and we want to include newcomers, huahua delegators, nomic delegators and neighbouring participants on active, small validators. Participation means presence, voting, development of tools, helping and experimenting as well. So we'll tend to repair this in future snapshots.

<h2>Idea on Wind Oracle</h2>
<p>We can risk a little part of our commission reward as validators in order to contribute or substract to a black box ($JUNO-$WIND) in junoswap. How would this work? -We still don't know if this is a good (or terrible) idea or burning mechanisms for tokens in $JUNO should be studied, but in principle one can control the price of one asset against another taking as an example a junoswap Liquidity Pool.
<p>On a windy day: If $JUNOs are swapped into a static $JUNO-$WIND Liquidity Pool for $WINDs, then the $WIND asset will be substracted, and therefore the price of $WIND will increase. It also makes sense that $JUNO is cheaper respecting $WIND, because $JUNO is our utility token and the main reason why some servers would be put to work. Given that some energy is blowing around us, it makes sense to contribute making the $JUNO token cheaper.
<p>On a calmed warm day: If nothing is done, it will automatically have an opposite effect... Hopefully large swaps of $WIND for $JUNO will happen, decreasing the price of $WIND and increasing the utility price of $JUNO. It makes sense, as the energy will be more expensive on that day for us, validators, and also for everyone using any computer. Better being outside enjoying from the warm calmed weather with a zero-energy usage right? In any case you can always use your $JUNO with our natural low fees, and hopefully the value increases always. (to the moon!)

<p>As it was pointed out, it makes sense to divide this utility between both hemispheres, having summer in June-September in northern latitudes and summer again in September-June in the southern latitudes. Price of both assets will be auto-regulated, hopefully.
