This event ends March 1st (which gives delegators with an address funded as of Feb. 1st Midnight UTC a month to complete the delegation requirements to qualify for the prize), and there is a prize pool address that can receive additional contributions. There is not just one winner for this prize; there could potentially be more than 2,000 addresses receiving a share of the prize pool. Please see the link below for the full details.\nThis proposal will authorize a 5,000,000 $HUAHUA contribution from the community pool to the prize pool address.\nBy contributing to this event, the Chihuahua Chain has a chance to use it's meme power as a way to raise awareness about how decentralizing validator power is essential to the health of every sovereign chain in the Cosmos ecosystem.\n\n_Link for details about the event:_\n https://jabbey-io.medium.com/chihuahuachain-80-20-giveaway-d4fdee1d07be \n_Prize pool address:_\n https://www.mintscan.io/chihuahua/account/chihuahua1vf2cwmapd77tsxewd04s66deu4t4jn5zf76lmw",
