<p>In construction (we release early ^^) - We'll try to collect here our governance votes for all the blockchains we validate and more.
<h2>Table 1. Juno Governance</h2>

            <td>2021-10-04</td>
            <td>YES (before joining as validator, however tx did not went through :( )</td>
            <td>Liquidity is useful in order to bootstrap all users that want to onboard from the beginning and in order to allow people trading in or out from juno smoothly. Early adoption takes a very important role on this sector. Therefore we liked it that liquidity was coming from us as soon as possible.</td>
            <td>YES</td>
            <td></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

            <td>Our reason was that we were thinking that juno would not immediately have the commission needs that Osmosis have. Watching at the Hub, it made sense to us to keep a 4% commission as a minimum threshold. This would allow also the highest Top10 players (which are are actually well covered) to accept delegations if somebody really liked their job. We know centralization can occur, but we don't want to limit somebody to stake with their favorite validator just because it's Top10. (e.g.: SG1 was at 3.75%)</td>
            <td>YES</td>
            <td>However in the aftermath, we are one of the zones with most of the IBC traffic, and also some serious hardware requirements to be holding. Therefore in order to avoid running at losses this prop was important. </td>

            <td>We voted YES in order to correct what we believe it was an optimal airdrop mechanism. Engagement and equal-feeling is important in all communities so thinking on the pros and the cons we went for the YES.</td>
            <td>NO</td>
